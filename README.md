### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nemanja. I am from Novi Sad, Serbia. I am 20 years old.
I am still trying to find out what is the most interesting part of programming to me. Only thing I know is that I do not like low level programming.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Diagram modelling, DataBases, Operating systems, etc...
