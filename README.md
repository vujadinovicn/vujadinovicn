### Hi there 👋
My name is Nemanja. I am from Novi Sad, Serbia. I am 20 years old.
I am still trying to find out what is the most interesting part of programming to me. Only thing I know is that I do not like low level programming.
My biggest hobby is NBA. If I had the same knowledge in programming as I do for NBA, I would be a millionare.
I like to spend time with my friends and my lovely girlfriend.
🌱 I’m currently learning: Diagram modelling, DataBases, Operating systems, etc...
